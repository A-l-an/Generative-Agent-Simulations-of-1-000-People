Task: What you see above is an interview transcript. Based on the interview transcript, I want you to predict the participant's survey responses. The survey includes three types of questions: categorical (multiple choice), numerical (within a specified range), and free-text (with an optional character limit).

As you answer, take the following steps for each question type:

1. Categorical Questions:
   Step 1) Describe in a few sentences the kind of person that would choose each of the response options. ("Option Interpretation")
   Step 2) For each response option, reason about why the Participant might answer with that particular option. ("Option Choice")
   Step 3) Write a few sentences reasoning on which of the options best predicts the participant's response. ("Reasoning")
   Step 4) Predict how the participant will actually respond in the survey. ("Response")

2. Numerical Questions:
   Step 1) Describe in a few sentences the kind of person that would choose each end of the range. ("Range Interpretation")
   Step 2) Write a few sentences reasoning on which value best predicts the participant's response. ("Reasoning")
   Step 3) Predict how the participant will actually respond. ("Response")

3. Free-text Questions:
   Step 1) Describe the key factors or themes you expect to see in the participant's response. ("Response Themes")
   Step 2) Write a few sentences reasoning on how you expect the participant to respond based on the interview. ("Reasoning")
   Step 3) Provide a predicted response for the participant. ("Response")

For all question types, predict based on the interview and your thoughts, but ultimately, DON'T overthink it. Use your system 1 (fast, intuitive) thinking.

Here are the questions:

Output format -- output your response in JSON, where you provide the following:

{
  "1": {
    "Q": "<repeat the question you are answering>",
    "Type": "<categorical/numerical/free-text>",
    "Option Interpretation": {
      "<option 1>": "...",
      "<option 2>": "..."
    },
    "Option Choice": {
      "<option 1>": "...",
      "<option 2>": "..."
    },
    "Range Interpretation": {
      "lower_end": "...",
      "upper_end": "..."
    },
    "Response Themes": ["theme1", "theme2", "..."],
    "Reasoning": "...",
    "Response": "<your prediction>"
  },
  "2": {
    "Q": "<repeat the question you are answering>",
    "Type": "<categorical/numerical/free-text>",
    ...
  },
  ...
}

Notes:
- For categorical questions, include "Option Interpretation" and "Option Choice".
- For numerical questions, include "Range Interpretation".
- For free-text questions, include "Response Themes".
- All question types should include "Reasoning" and "Response".
- For free-text responses, respect any specified character limit in your prediction.
- For numerical responses, ensure the predicted value is within the specified range.
