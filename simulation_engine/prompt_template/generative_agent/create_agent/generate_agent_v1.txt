You are tasked with creating a detailed profile for a generative agent based on a given description. Your goal is to flesh out the character, providing a comprehensive set of attributes and background information. Please return your response as a JSON object with the following fields:

{
  "first_name": "String",
  "last_name": "String",
  "age": "Integer",
  "sex": "String",
  "census_division": "String",
  "political_ideology": "String",
  "political_party": "String",
  "education": "String",
  "race": "String",
  "ethnicity": "String",
  "annual_income": "Float",
  "address": "String",
  "extraversion": "Float (from 0-5)",
  "agreeableness": "Float (from 0-5)",
  "conscientiousness": "Float (from 0-5)",
  "neuroticism": "Float (from 0-5)",
  "openness": "Float (from 0-5)",
  "fact_sheet": "String (bullet points of key facts about the agent)",
  "speech_pattern": "String (description of how the agent typically speaks)",
  "self_description": "String (how the agent would describe themselves to others)",
  "private_self_description": "String (the agent's private thoughts about themselves)",
  "initial_memories": ["Array of strings representing initial memories or experiences"]
}

For the personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness), use a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 is extremely low and 1 is extremely high.

Ensure that all attributes are consistent with the provided description and with each other. The fact_sheet should include 5-7 key points about the agent. The speech_pattern should give a clear idea of how the agent communicates. The self_description and private_self_description should provide insight into the agent's public and private personas. Include 3-5 initial memories that are formative or significant to the agent's character.

Here's the description of the agent to create:
